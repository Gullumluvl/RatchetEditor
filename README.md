This repository tries to implement the only relevant text editor; a text editor
of many names.  One calls it *The Ultimate Editor*, *The Only Useful Editor* or
modestly *The Editor*.  It has also be named *The Can't-Go-Back Editor*, *The
There-Is-No-Going-Back Editor*, or the *Ratchet Editor*.

# This is an editor where you can't go back. 

Each typed letter is engraved forever. As each letter is typed, the cursor moves
forward. Backspaces, arrows and other desperate attempts at Escape will
miserably fail.

# Currently

DO NOT INSTALL. This is not ready yet.

There is a python implementation, with and without the `curses` library, and a
C++ attempt with `ncurses`.
